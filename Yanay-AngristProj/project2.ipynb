    "**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm P.T. on Friday, 4/9. Projects will be accepted up to 2 days (48 hours) late; a project submitted less than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 2/3 credit, a project submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the deadline will receive 1/3 credit, and a project submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline will receive no credit. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit on the checkpoint, you must complete section 1 and 2 of Part 1, pass all public autograder tests, and submit to okpy by 11:59pm P.T. on Friday, 4/2. This is worth 1 point of your entire project grade. After you've submitted the checkpoint, you may still change your answers before the project deadline - only your final submission will be graded for correctness. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner; your partner must be from your assigned lab section. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit. Feel free to split up the work between your partner, share what you complete with each other in a google document, and share your screen in a Zoom call as you work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your discussion TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/sp21/staff.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** The tests that are given are **not comprehensive** and passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work! You might want to create your own checks along the way to see if your answers make sense. Additionally, before you submit, make sure that none of your cells take a very long time to run (several minutes). Each question is worth 1 point of your total project grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Free Response Questions:** Make sure that you put the answers to the written questions in the indicated cell we provide. **Every free response question should include an explanation** that adequately answers the question. Check to make sure that you have a [Gradescope](http://gradescope.com) account, which is where the scores to the free response questions will be posted. If you do not, make sure to reach out to your assigned TA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You **never** have to use just one line in this project or any others. Use intermediate variables and multiple lines as much as you would like!\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the concepts necessary for this project are found in the textbook. If you are stuck on a particular problem, reading through the relevant textbook section often will help clarify the concept.\n",
